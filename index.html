<h2><em>My personal experience with meditation</em> </h2>
<p> Hi, name is Daniel Gage and I'm here to tell you how mediation can positively help with your mental health.</p>
<p> For me, my mental health started to decline when my gap year in New Zealand was coming to an end. I was facing the reality of going back to an Country which I didn't want to be in, having no idea what career I would like and having to leave an Country which I fell in love with.</p>
<p> It was affecting the job I was in at the time, my relationship and overall well-being. I felt like I wanted to escape and run away. <br>
I knew things had to change within myself and I had no idea how.</p>
<p> I have always been the type of person to hide my feelings and just get on with life, however, after being back in the U.K. for 6 months, things were only getting worse and I had a complete breakdown.<br>
I didn't want to be alive anymore and I knew it was time I needed help.<br>
The Doctors gave me antidepressants, which helped to begin with and still do to this day. I started online counselling but I felt like I couldn't relate to anyone so I started looking into mediation and mindfulness.</p>
<p>Learning mediation was hard but I persevered with the help of the Headspace app.<br>
I first felt different after a week or so, I wasn't waking up in such a bad mood which drastically changed my day to day life. I felt alot happier about my life and it was the push that I needed to make a change in my life.</p>
<p>Me and my partner brought a van to convert into a campervan to travel and work in, which has always been my dream. That seemed like a lifetime away at one point and I didn't think it was ever going to happen.</p>
<p>I enrolled onto a Web and Software Development course and I am now on the right path.</p>
<p>Yes, I still have bad days or weeks sometimes but if I keep up with my daily meditation, I find that it really helps.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The truth is, you can seek help, through councelling, family and friends but the only person that can truly help you see the other side is <b>YOURSELF</b></p>
