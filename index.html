<h2><em>My personal experience with meditation</em></h2>

<p id="mainp"> Hi, my name is Daniel Gage and I'm here to tell you how mediation can positively help with your mental health.
<br>
 For me, my mental health started to decline when my gap year in New Zealand was coming to an end. I was facing the reality of going back to a Country which I didn't want to be in, having no idea what career I would like to do and having to leave a Country which I fell in love with.
It was affecting the job I was in at the time, my relationship and overall well-being. I felt like I wanted to escape and run away. 
<br>
<b>I knew things had to change within myself but I had no idea how!</b>
<br>
I have always been the type of person to hide my feelings and just get on with life, however, after being back in the U.K. for 6 months, things were only getting worse and I had a complete breakdown.
I didn't want to be alive anymore and I knew it was time I needed help.
<br>
The Doctors gave me antidepressants, which helped to begin with and still do, to this day. I started online counselling but I felt like I couldn't relate to anyone so I started looking into mediation and mindfulness.
</p>
<p>
Learning mediation was hard but I persevered with the help of the Headspace app.<br>
I first felt different after a week or so, I wasn't waking up in such a bad mood which drastically changed my day to day life. I felt alot happier about my life and it was the push that I needed to make a change in my life.
Yes, I still have bad days or weeks sometimes but if I keep up with my daily meditation, I find that it really helps.
<br>
I enrolled onto a Web and Software Development course, me and my partner brought a van and converted it into a Campervan (DIY STYLE) and now plan to both get remote jobs, to enable us to travel and work around the world!
<br>
</p>

<p>The truth is, you can seek help, through councelling, family and friends but the only person that can truly help you see the other side is <b><u>YOURSELF</u></b></p>
