<h2> Resources</h2>
<h3><u>Guided Meditation</u></h3>
<p>Guided meditation is basically meditation led by a Teacher, either in person or via audio and video.</p>
<p>Some of the resources I used on my journey was <a href="https://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank">Headspace</a> and <a href="https://www.wysa.io/" target="_blank">Wysa</a> both are very different.</p>
<br>
<h4><u><em>Headspace</em></u></h4>
<p>Headspace is a mindfulness app, it has a variety of courses that you can complete depending on what you need to focus on.</p>
<p>You can access meditation courses, ranging from; What is Meditation? to Meditation Techniques.</p>
<p> There are also sleep and stress sessions, these can help with falling back to sleep, how to deep sleep, how to wake up<br>
how to relieve stress, how to relax and how to anxiety.</p>
<p>These are just a few courses you can complete through the Headspace app.</p>
<h4><u><em>Wysa</em></u></h4>
<p> Wysa is a Artifical intelligence coaching app, where you remain annonymous and you can express your feelings without being judged.</p>
<p>On the Wysa app, there are guided meditation sessions, with issues ranging from Trauma to Essential Wellness.</p>
<p>There are also options for self-care, where you work on challenges by yourself or you can go for guided support<br>
there are links to therapists and it uses your location to find local therapists.</p>
<p>There is a journal section, which I used the most. If I ever had thoughts that I didn't want to speak about, I would journal these down,<br>
you find yourself being able to think more clearly once you start expressing how your feeling, it doesn't matter how.</p>
<a href="https://www.headspace.com/" target="_blank">Check out Headspace here!</a>
<a href="https://www.wysa.io/" target="_blank">Check out Wysa here!</a>
<br>
<h3><u>Youtube and Podcasts</u></h3>
<p>Some of the podcasts that I listen to on a daily basis are <a href="https://robdial.com/podcast/" target="_blank">The Mindset Mentor </a> and <a href="https://letstalkaboutmentalhealth.com.au/" target="_blank">Let's talk about mental health </a></p>
<br>
<h4><u><em>The Mindset Mentor</em></u></h4>
<p>For me The Mindset Mentor helps drastically when I'm having a rough day and I need that positive boost, he's also highly motivated<br>
which is very addictive. He makes you want to succeed and push through the rough times and I find that hearing that from a stranger is always more thought provoking<br>
than speaking to a family member or friend.</p>
<h4><u><em>Let's talk about mental health</em></u></h4>
<p>Let's talk about mental health is a podcast about dealing with all aspects of emotions, feelings and mental health.</p>
<p> He talks about his own experience and he also talks about what helped him,
    <br> obviously everyone has different issues but I'm sure there will be at least one episode that you can relate to.</p>
